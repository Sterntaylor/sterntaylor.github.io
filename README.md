# Code Refactor Finished Code
Taylor Stern
My edits were documented in the bottom of my css code as well.
/* edit notes
    Compressed benefits by giving them the same class, then fixing the CSS to match (benefit,h3,img)
    by doing this I was able to delete 6 css lines that were unnecessary.

    Compressed Search Engine Opt/Online Rep mng/Social Media Mkt into one class, OMM(optimization, management, marketing)
    By compressing these into one class I was able to delete an additional 6 css lines that were unncecessary.

    Deleted line .header h1 .seo {color: #d9dcd6;} Served no purpose visually. 
    I tested this by openning 2 windows of index.html, deleted the line and saved.
    Refreshed only 1 of the windows and compared. No visual difference.
